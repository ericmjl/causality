For me, coming in with a fairly shallow network science background, I could not see how \"a path\" could be traced from $A$ to $D$ in the following graph:\n",

    "Yes, but only if we accept the traditional \"network science\" definitions of a path. In causal inference, a path is just any undirected connection between variables; a directed path, on the other hand, has to follow the directions on the edges. Therefore, we have to consider the \"undirected\" version of the graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A - B - C - D$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanically, what we are doing when we finding out whether two nodes $n_1$ and $n_2$ are $d$-separated or not is to first start with the undirected version of the causal graph, then find every single path between the two nodes in the undirected graph, then see if there are blockers to independence between $n_1$ and $n_2$ in the directed version of the graph (as determined by three rules, which I will go through below).\n",
